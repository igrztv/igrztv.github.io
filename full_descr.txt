I organized full stack of development process — from an idea to the product to be pu on the market:
<ul>
	<li>Market researching, customer development</li>
	<li>Organizing teamwork, task managing for software developers, technical writes, cost and quality analyzing</li>
	<li>Product testing</li>
	<li>Preparing for release</li>
<ul>


Educational kit in 2 variants: for Arduino and for Espruino (Javascript).
<br><br>
I implanted developing processes for manufacturing kits in <a href="#jobs">Amperka</a> company. It became a conveyor. Also, I integrated product testing, improved quality.
<ul>
	<li>Now we generate new kits quarterly (2 times quicker)</li>
	<li>Reduced cost by 30%</li>
<ul>

Hardware project for monitoring contunious development. I've got a traffic light and connected relays to each light. Javascript code runs on STM32 and requests JSON via HTTPS.
<ul>
	<li>Electric wiring</li>					
	<li>Programming in Javascript</li>
	<li>Get request from Travis CI API</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO-rHkXpbQQ">Youtube video</a></li>
<ul>

				First Russian industrial delta-robot by <a href="#jobs">BitRobotics</a>. My task was to develop navigation system and object recognition.
				<ul>
					<li>Computer vision with openCV</li>
					<li>Customer support</li>
					<li>Writing code documentation</li>
				<ul>
				
My task was to design a part of conveyor. This part sets up the fish-sign on the bottles. I designed mechanical components, connected servo motors, ball screw lifts.
<ul>
	<li>3D modeling for milling and lathe machining</li>
	<li>Designing with GD&amp;T and food technolodies</li>
<ul>
